# Prepare your preferred editor Configuration

Before to edit a lot of configuration files, you better to prepare your personal preferred editor and shell environment before continuing.

For example, if you prefer the pre-installed `vim`, then you need to install `gvim` to enable the `clipboard` feature which 
makes your life a bit easier.

```bash
# It will ask you to remove the `vim-minimal` as a conflict, just says `Y`
sudo pacman -S gvim
```

Let's do it:)
